6) the program does not work on the files as provided in the "Data" folder as requested.
these are most of the major request in the assignment document. and it is not met al all

1) the .CPP and .H files are specifically requested for some of the classes in my request.

4) date, time, solar radiation, wind speed, ambient temperature are all not read and stored.
5) data with "N/A" were not handled and ignored as specifically requested.
6) the TEMPLATE BST AND STL MAP IS MADATORY to be impleted into the design of the whole program, this part was not done at all.
